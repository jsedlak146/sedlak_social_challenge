## Description

Our challenge was to create a backend for a social media website using NoSQL technology. We were to add functionality like adding and deleting users and thoughts, also being able to update things on the site. We also utilized Node and Express, and tested the routes in Insomia. Below are the links to my GitHub repo and video:

## Installation

I began by refactoring some code from another activity which was functionally similar, but I needed to add more routes and controllers to make it fit for my usage. The models were also completely re-written to hold the information I would be needing.  After writing the appropriate routes and making their corresponding controllers for both users and thoughts, I was able to create, edit and delete users, thoughts and reactions.

## Usage

To use the back end application, simply enter the integrated terminal and start the application by typing into the command line "node server.js".
